## New UI Version of VidAnon Tool
Instead of using the .exe, you can instead install the PyQt6 package in Python using ```pip install PyQt6``` from your terminal. <br>
And then install the deface package using ```-m pip install deface``` (this can be skipped if you already have deface installed).

Then you only have to run the **Video_Anonymize_pyqtversion_1.1** file from the .zip to get started with the program.


Required packages: **Deface** (https://pypi.org/project/deface/), **PyQt6** (https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)


Currently working on an exe and deployment version of this similar to the TKinter version but for now running the .py file should work

## Older method
Has been removed, please use the Video_Anonymize_pyqtversion_1.1 from the repository.

Old instruction video:
You can still follow this to install Python and Deface on your system.

## Important to know:
deface runs from the command line, meaning running it as a function at the script level does not work. We need to run it through the terminal or shell level.
This UI tool helps give the input and output arguments for the deface function which is passed into the command line.



## USAGE: 
Download the file as a .zip and extract to any directory. Run the **Video_Anonymize_pyqtversion_1.1** file. This requires the deface package and the PyQt6 package.
